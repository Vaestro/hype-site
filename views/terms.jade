The Platform is a communication medium, comprising content, products and services (collectively, the "Services") which enable individuals and groups of people (“Clients”) and hosts (“Hosts”, collectively with Clients, “user” or “users” or “you” or “your”) to connect. Clients seeking to get entry into venues and events (“Venue” or “Event”) of preference reach out to, interact with, chose and use the services of Hosts to gain access into the applicable Venue or Event (“Host Services”). 
          
          h3 I. Contractual Relationship
          
          p These Terms of Use (the "Terms" or the “Agreement”) govern your access to, and use of, the Services made available by us on the Platform.</br> In these Terms, the words "including" and "include" mean "including, but not limited to." </br> By accessing and using the Platform and/or using our Services, you are agreeing to be bound by the following Terms without modification, limitation or qualification. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you. Please read them carefully. Please also note that we may, at our sole discretion, modify or revise these Terms at any time by updating the text of this page without notice to you, and you are bound by any such modification or revision. You should therefore visit this page periodically to review the Terms. Your continued access, use or browsing on this Platform following the posting of changes to the Terms, means you accept those modifications or revisions.</br> Hypelist may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason or no reason at all. </br> Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, activity or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable Service(s). Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Service(s). They are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms, and become part of your agreement with us if you use the applicable Services. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services. </br> Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferrable license to: (i) access and use the Platform on your personal device solely in connection with your use of the Services; and (ii) access and use any content, information and related materials that may be made available through the Services, in each case solely for your personal, noncommercial use. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by us and our licensors. </br></br> In addition to the use specified herein, the Terms found here apply to any software (including any updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation) that we make available to you from time to time for your use in connection with our Services (the “Platform Software”) and terms of the software license agreement accompanying such Platform Software (the "License Agreement"), and is further conditioned on your agreement to be bound by the terms of the License Agreement. </br> Please note that any unauthorized use of the Platform automatically terminates the permission or license granted to use this Platform. </br> We are not responsible for the performance of Hosts or Clients, nor do we have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever relating to user connection nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any users. We do not have control over the quality, timing or legality of Host Services delivered by Hosts. We make no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Host Services requested and provided by Hosts identified through the Service whether in public, private, or offline interactions.

          h3 C. No Waiver
          p Our failure to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms or to exercise any right under these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of our right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.
